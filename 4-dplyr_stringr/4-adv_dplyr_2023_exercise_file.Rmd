## Take a look at your data
```{r}

```

## Advanced `filter()` and `select()`
```{r}
# Only keep rows that contain either a "B" or a "T" value in the `BT` column
# the wrong way


# one correct way


# another correct way


# Only keep columns that contain "." in their names

```

## Combining data frames
```{r}
# inner join


# left join
gene_df %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(ALL_df, by = "sample")
# what happens if we change the order?

# what's the difference?

# right join
gene_df %>% 
  dplyr::right_join(ALL_df, by = "sample")

# anti-join
gene_df %>% 
  dplyr::anti_join(ALL_df, by = "sample")
```

## Introducing the `{stringr}` package
```{r}
# detect all entries in the `mol.biol` column that contain a "/" in them


# How many such entries are there?

  
# convert "/" to "-"


# make this change to `ALL_df` 


# stringr cheatsheet
# https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf

# Advanced example
# Take a look at the `citog` column. Notice that there are some entries with parentheses in them
# Populate a new column called "in_parentheses" that contains just this information (if present), including the parentheses

```
