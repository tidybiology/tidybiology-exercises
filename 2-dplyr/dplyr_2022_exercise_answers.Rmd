```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

## Required package and data set

Run the code in the code chunk below to load the necessary data set - `cytomegalovirus`
```{r}
#install.packages("medicaldata")
library(medicaldata)

# For more information on this package and the various data sets it contains, visit -
# https://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata
# this is a treasure trove of interesting data sets!

data("cytomegalovirus") # loads this data set 
View(cytomegalovirus) # View this data set
?cytomegalovirus # launches the help page for this data set
```

## Please answer the following questions 

Take a look at the `cytomegalovirus` data frame. How many different types of variables does it contain? 

Hint: Take a glimpse at your data  

What are the dimensions of this data frame?  

```{r}
glimpse(cytomegalovirus)
```

How would you select just the columns `time.to.transplant`, `time.to.agvhd`, `time.to.cgvhd`, and `time.to.cmv` from the `cytomegalovirus` data frame?

**Bonus**: Can you identify a helpful function that will help you do this with less typing? Go through this list - https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_tidy_select.html

```{r}
cytomegalovirus %>% 
  select(time.to.transplant, time.to.agvhd, time.to.cgvhd, time.to.cmv)
```

How would you select everything between (and including) `CD34.dose` and `cmv`?

```{r}
cytomegalovirus %>% 
  select(CD34.dose:cmv)
```

**Bonus**: Select all variables that **do not** have `.` in their names?

```{r}
cytomegalovirus %>% 
  select(!contains("."))
```

Filter the `cytomegalovirus` data frame so that it only contains information for patients with acute myeloid leukemia

```{r}
cytomegalovirus %>% 
  filter(diagnosis == "acute myeloid leukemia")
```

Now use `filter()` to only keep data for female patients with acute myeloid leukemia 

First try this using multiple filter statements, and then try without writing multiple filter statements 

```{r}
# with multiple filter statements
cytomegalovirus %>%
  filter(diagnosis == "acute myeloid leukemia") %>% 
  filter(sex == 1)
  
# one statement
cytomegalovirus %>%
  filter(diagnosis == "acute myeloid leukemia",
         sex == 1)
```

Filter out information for patients who have a **below average** time.to.transplant

Hint: Use the base R function `mean()` for this question  

**WARNING**: Is your output an empty data frame? You will need to change the value of one of the arguments of the `mean()` function. Go through the function's documentation to decide which one  

```{r}
cytomegalovirus %>% 
  filter(time.to.transplant > mean(time.to.transplant, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Create a new variable called `time.to.transplant.years` that contains the time.to.transplant for each patient in *years*

As a bonus, re-order the resulting data frame in descending order of `time.to.transplant.years` 

```{r}
cytomegalovirus %>% 
  mutate(time.to.transplant.years = time.to.transplant/12) %>% 
  arrange(desc(time.to.transplant.years))
```

Let's now find out which diseases have the longest time to transplant. We'll do this by working out the average `time.to.transplant` for each diagnosis

```{r}
cytomegalovirus %>% 
  group_by(diagnosis) %>% 
  summarise(mean(time.to.transplant, na.rm = TRUE))
```
