```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

## Required packages and datasets

Run the code in the code chunk below to load the necessary dataset -  `proteins`

```{r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("matthewhirschey/tidybiology", force = TRUE)
library(tidybiology)
data(proteins)
```

## Please answer the following questions

How would you get the sequence lengths for all the entries in the `proteins` dataframe? Hint: first take a `glimpse()` at this dataframe to see which column would be relevant to this question
```{r}
glimpse(proteins)
str_count(proteins$sequence)
```

Count the number of lysines in each sequence
```{r}
str_count(proteins$sequence, "K")
```

For each sequence, how many times does an arginine follow a lysine?
```{r}
str_count(proteins$sequence, "KR")
```

How would you test if the following motif - "RCP.L" - was in a particular sequence? How many proteins contain this motif? What does the "." mean?
```{r}
str_detect(proteins$sequence, "RCP.L")
sum(str_detect(proteins$sequence, "RCP.L"))
# "." represents any character
```

How would you create a new dataframe that only contains proteins that contain the "RCP.L" motif?
```{r}
proteins %>% 
  filter(str_detect(sequence, "RCP.L"))
```

Identify proteins that contain the E-box motif - "CANNTG". Create a new column called `e_box` that contains a `TRUE` if a sequence has this motif and a `FALSE` otherwise
```{r}
proteins %>% 
  mutate(e_box = str_detect(sequence, "CA..TG")) %>% 
  relocate(e_box) # this moves the named column to the start of the data frame
```

What are the mean protein lengths for proteins that contain an E-box versus proteins that do not?
```{r}
proteins %>% 
  mutate(e_box = str_detect(sequence, "CA..TG")) %>% 
  group_by(e_box) %>% 
  summarise(mean_length = mean(length))
```
